1. Motivation for the Study
I wondered whether atoms on the surface of a metal object could be detached even by a small external force.

2. Related Scientific Concepts
To break the bonds between atoms, energy greater than the bonding energy is required.
For example, iron contains about 
10^22 atoms per gram, so the mass of a single atom is extremely small.

3. Scientific Analysis
The force produced when scratching metal with a fingernail or teeth is not strong enough to exceed the bonding energy.
Therefore, it is unlikely that many atoms would be detached at once.
However, if the force is concentrated on a very small area, it is possible that a few atoms could be removed.

4. Conclusion
In theory, this is possible, but in real life it is very difficult to observe.
This is because the effect of only a few atoms is negligible.
Through this study, I learned that science can explain phenomena we cannot directly see by using logical reasoning.
